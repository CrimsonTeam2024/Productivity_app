Navbar
- animation idea: spacing 0 -> final (currently 30)
- 'unfolding' from center like a deck of cards on startup. noyce.
- Also, the navbar could shift from y = -height , also noyce.

Focus button
- This should be an element of the list item (it's activation button),
	not part of a separate view altogether (it's nor even nested in
	the Task List at the moment)
- Its OnClick refers to a FocusController script BUT:
	- I think we should parameterise a call to activate the FocusOverlay,
	which then initialises with data passed to it from the task item
	(which literally just stores its value and time in text elements)
